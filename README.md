# JavaMediaOrganizer
I will not be maintaining this repository very actively as this is just intended my personal use. Im just putting it out there in case someone else also has a use for it or might want to expand it to fit other special needs.
Additionally to the provided source code a precompiled .jar file will be included in each release.

## What is it?
The JavaMediaOrganizer is a simple completely local tool to organize different kinds of media. It is aimed at providing an overview of a collection of media and keep track of what is where. The location of a specific item can be either in the form of a link for digitally stored media (e.g. file or website) or a description of the physical location (e.g. "On the shelf next to the TV in the living room, bottom most row on the right.").

## How to use it?
Eventually a guide might be added to the [wiki](https://github.com/Chromfalke/JavaMediaOrganizer/wiki) but I'm not making any guarantees.

## Planned features
- provide organization for
  - Books
  - Movies
  - Music
  - Playlists/CDs
  - Videos
  - Pictures
- view all custom tags to check for any misspelling during creation
- more complex search functionality
  - include/exclude types of media, special tags
  - randomized search with variable constraints
- sync data via a cloud (e.g. Google Drive, Onedrive)
- other? (if someone has a suggestion I like, I might add it)
